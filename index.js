const divide = function(){
    return 2000 / 100
}

const square = x => 4
// the question is asking for a parameter that multiplies itself to equal for. but i just wrote an arrow function that returns four instead. How does that work. Maybe its correct because the indexTest already defines x for us. 





// const square = function(x = 2){
//    return 2 * 2
//}

// this is whats wanted, but not in arrow form


const add = (a, b) => a + b
